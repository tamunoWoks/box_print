# Box Print Script
The Box Print Script is a simple Python utility that draws a hollow rectangular box on the console using a specified symbol, width, and height.  
The script demonstrates:
- Input validation with `raise Exception`
- Printing structured patterns in Python
- Using `try/except` blocks for error handling

### Features:
- Draws a rectangular box with a customizable symbol, width, and height.
- Ensures input validation:
    - The symbol must be exactly one character.
    - The width and height must be greater than 2.
- Catches errors gracefully and displays user-friendly messages.
- Example test cases included to demonstrate both valid and invalid inputs.
